# Lex's Balatro Mod

This is a simple small mod I've made that has various references and friends of mine made into balatro cards! I also made my own page of spectral cards, and a unique "Curse" enhancement mechanic!

Mod made using the wonderful tool JokerForge by [Jayden Holdsworth](https://github.com/Jayd-H)
All visual assets made by me, and sounds are from various sources but also edited by me.
Thank you tokagashi.bird for testing the mod with me <3
